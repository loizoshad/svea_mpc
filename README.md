# Autonomous navigation and parking of a SVEA robot

## Description

This repository contains the source-code for autonomously controlling the Small Vehicles for Autonomy (SVEA) platform [1]. More precisely, it contains the implementaion of a nonlinear model predictive controller that allows the vehicle to navigate towards a parking spot and then perform a parking maneuver for both parallel and perpendicular parking. In addition, it contains safety elements in the form of avoiding collisions with moving obstacles in its near vicinity.


## Setup

### Dependencies

The package requires that the SVEA framework https://github.com/KTH-SML/svea is installed.

## Demo

A demonstration of an implementation on the real robot can be seen in the video below.
